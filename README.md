### 📍Project Discription
This is a console-based Student Management System developed in C++. It allows users to manage basic student information such as roll number, name, marks, and grade. The program provides a simple interface to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records, helping manage academic performance effectively. It uses file handling to store and retrieve data persistently.
